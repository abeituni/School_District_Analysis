# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to remove Math & Test scores for 9th grade Thomas High School students because Maria & the school board believe there might have been some sort of academic dishonesty. Once we remove the test scores for these students, we can rerun our data.

## Results
-In terms of changes to the District Summary, they were very minimal. 
-The District Summary was not affected very much by these changes. 
-Replacing the math and reading scores did not affect Thomas High School's performance relative to other schools very much; Thomas High School is still a top 2 performing school in both data sets. 
-The Passing Math percentage dropped about .20% and the Passing Reading percentage increased about .10%. The Overall Passing percentage dropped about .20% for Thomas High School. Scores by School Size & Type did not change very much, but percentages did decrease by about 5% for each category (Reading, Math & Overall Passing Percentage).

## Summary
For Thomas High School, the changes reflected in the updated distric analysis are as follows. Math & Overall Passing Percentages dropped for the school, while Reading increased very slightly. Percentages for the school size (1000-2000) dropped. Percentages for School Type (Charter) dropped as well.
